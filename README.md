# UCSY Facebook Messenger Chatbot (Un-official)


## Brief Introduction
This is Sample UCSY Facebook Messenger Chatbot. On this chatbot, you can do
- decide whether Student. 
- look Timetable. 
- search Exam Result
- search Tutorial Date.

On top of that, this repo includes implementation for "Human Handover Protocol" implementation and sending "Originating Message" functions. 

I have integrated Natural Language Processing into this Chatbot. For both of these, I use "Wit.ai" services api which is supported by Facebook. The project is developed with BotMan Studio Framework and MySql database.

## Technologies
This project is simply built by Php Laravel Framework. The following are the techs that this project utilize:
- Laravel
- Botman
- MySql
- Wit.ai

## Setting Up
I recommend to read this article where I wrote details about the step by step of how to setup the **BotMan Chatbot**.


## Todo
- Most business-logic code (currently most of the business logic code are written in pseudo mode)
- Admin Panel Setup
- Full-blown Database Setup
- Zawgyi/Unicode Support (currently only support Zawgyi)


## Apology in Advanced
This Chatbot is developed within 3 days. So it still has so many requirements. But I think it can served as a starting point for most of the curious developers at least.
